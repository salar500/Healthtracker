    <h1>Signs You're Not Drinking Enough Water</h1>

    <p>Dehydration can affect your body more quickly than you might think. Here are the most common symptoms that signal you need more water.</p>

    <h2>1. Dark Yellow Urine</h2>
    <p>Light straw-colored urine is ideal. Darker shades indicate dehydration.</p>

    <h2>2. Persistent Headaches</h2>
    <p>Even mild dehydration can trigger headaches or difficulty concentrating.</p>

    <h2>3. Dry Mouth or Bad Breath</h2>
    <p>Lack of saliva causes bacterial growth, leading to dryness and odor.</p>

    <h2>4. Fatigue and Low Energy</h2>
    <p>Water is essential for circulation and oxygen flow. Lower intake = more fatigue.</p>

    <h2>5. Dizziness or Lightheadedness</h2>
    <p>Dehydration can temporarily reduce blood pressure, causing dizziness.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use the Hydration Calculator to know exactly how much water your body needs.</p>
