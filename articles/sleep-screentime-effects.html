    <h1>How Screen Time Affects Your Sleep</h1>

    <p>Using phones, laptops, or TVs before bed can reduce sleep quality significantly. Here’s how screen time disrupts your sleep — and how to fix it.</p>

    <h2>1. Blue Light Blocks Melatonin Production</h2>
    <p>The blue light from screens suppresses melatonin, the hormone your body uses to feel sleepy.</p>

    <h2>2. Mental Stimulation Keeps the Brain Awake</h2>
    <p>Social media, gaming, and videos keep your mind alert — not ideal before bedtime.</p>

    <h2>3. Shorter and Lighter Sleep Cycles</h2>
    <p>Studies show that late-night screen use leads to more awakenings and shorter REM sleep.</p>

    <h2>4. Best Practices to Reduce Screen Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Stop using screens **at least 1 hour before bed**.</li>
      <li>Enable **blue light filter / night mode** on your devices.</li>
      <li>Keep your room dark and cool for better sleep.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Reducing screen time at night can dramatically improve the quality of your rest.</p>
