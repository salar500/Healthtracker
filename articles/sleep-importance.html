      Why Sleep Is So Important for Your Health
    </h1>

    <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-6">
      Sleep is one of the most important factors for physical, mental, and emotional well-being.  
      Yet many people underestimate how much it affects energy, mood, weight, immunity, and overall health.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-3">1. Boosts Your Immune System</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      During sleep, your body produces important proteins called cytokines that help fight infections,  
      inflammation, and stress. Poor sleep weakens your immune response and increases your risk of illness.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-3">2. Improves Brain Function</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      Your brain uses sleep to clean out toxins, process memories, and prepare for the next day.  
      Good sleep improves:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-4">
      <li>concentration</li>
      <li>decision-making</li>
      <li>reaction times</li>
      <li>memory</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-3">3. Helps Maintain Healthy Weight</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      Hormones like ghrelin (hunger) and leptin (fullness) are heavily affected by sleep.  
      Lack of sleep increases cravings, overeating, and risk of weight gain.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-3">4. Supports Emotional Health</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      Sleep helps regulate mood and emotional balance. Poor sleep can increase:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-4">
      <li>stress</li>
      <li>irritability</li>
      <li>anxiety</li>
      <li>risk of depression</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-3">5. Repairs and Restores Your Body</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      Deep sleep is when your muscles, tissues, and cells repair themselves.  
      This is essential for recovery after exercise, injury, or illness.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-3">6. Improves Heart Health</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      Consistent sleep helps regulate blood pressure, reduce inflammation,  
      and lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-3">How Much Sleep Do You Need?</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      Experts recommend:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-4">
      <li><strong>7–9 hours</strong> for most adults</li>
      <li><strong>8–10 hours</strong> for teens</li>
      <li><strong>9–12 hours</strong> for children</li>
    </ul>
