    <h1>Why BMI Changes With Age</h1>

    <p>BMI is influenced not only by height and weight but also by natural aging processes.</p>

    <h2>1. Muscle Loss (Sarcopenia)</h2>
    <p>As you age, muscle mass decreases, which can raise body fat percentage even if BMI stays constant.</p>

    <h2>2. Metabolism Slows Down</h2>
    <p>Older adults burn fewer calories at rest, making weight gain easier.</p>

    <h2>3. Hormonal Changes</h2>
    <p>Shifts in hormones affect appetite, fat storage, and energy levels.</p>

    <h2>4. Bone Density Reduces</h2>
    <p>Lower bone mass can slightly reduce weight, affecting BMI calculations.</p>

    <p><strong>Important:</strong> BMI is less accurate for older adults—use it as a guide, not a diagnosis.</p>
