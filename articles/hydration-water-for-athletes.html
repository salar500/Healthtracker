    <h1>How Much Water Do Athletes Need Daily?</h1>

    <p>Athletes and active individuals need significantly more water due to sweating, higher metabolism, and muscle activity.</p>

    <h2>1. Baseline Water Needs</h2>
    <p>The average person needs around <strong>30–35 ml per kg of body weight</strong>. Athletes exceed this.</p>

    <h2>2. Add Water for Every Hour of Exercise</h2>
    <p>Add **0.5 to 1 liter** of water per hour of intense exercise.</p>

    <h2>3. Hydrate Before, During, and After Activity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Before:</strong> 500 ml water</li>
      <li><strong>During:</strong> 150–250 ml every 15–20 minutes</li>
      <li><strong>After:</strong> Replace fluids lost through sweat</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Check Sweat Loss</h2>
    <p>Weigh yourself before and after exercise. Each 1 kg lost = 1 liter water needed.</p>

    <h2>5. Include Electrolytes</h2>
    <p>During long workouts, drink fluids containing sodium, potassium, and magnesium.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The Hydration Calculator gives a solid estimate for your daily baseline intake.</p>
